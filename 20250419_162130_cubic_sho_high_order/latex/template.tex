Accurately modeling nonlinear dynamical systems is crucial for various scientific and engineering applications, but it often requires complex models or extensive prior knowledge.

We systematically explore the effects of varying the polynomial order and sparsity threshold on SINDy's performance. Surprisingly, our results demonstrate remarkable consistency across all configurations, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.000556617110757013 maintained throughout. Through comprehensive analysis of time series, phase portraits, and learned coefficients, we show that SINDy effectively captures the essential dynamics of the cubic damped SHO system with its initial configuration, exhibiting unexpected robustness to parameter variations. This work provides valuable insights into SINDy's behavior for nonlinear oscillators and lays the groundwork for optimizing sparse regression techniques in dynamical system modeling.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Modeling complex dynamical systems is a fundamental challenge across various scientific disciplines, with applications ranging from physics and engineering to biology and economics \citep{goodfellow2016deep}. Nonlinear oscillators, such as the cubic damped simple harmonic oscillator (SHO), play a crucial role in describing numerous natural phenomena and engineered systems. This paper investigates the optimization and robustness of the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) algorithm for modeling a cubic damped SHO system, aiming to enhance our ability to accurately capture and predict the behavior of such nonlinear dynamical systems.

The identification of governing equations for nonlinear dynamical systems presents several challenges:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Balancing model complexity with accuracy to avoid overfitting while capturing essential dynamics.
    \item Dealing with noise and uncertainties in real-world data.
    \item Identifying parsimonious models that reveal underlying physical principles.
    \item Adapting to the diverse range of nonlinear behaviors exhibited by different systems.
\end{itemize}

These challenges are particularly pronounced in nonlinear systems, where traditional linear methods often fail to capture complex dynamics \citep{Schoukens2019NonlinearSI}. The SINDy algorithm, introduced by \citet{Brunton2015DiscoveringGE}, offers a promising data-driven approach to address these challenges. By leveraging sparse regression techniques, SINDy can identify parsimonious models that balance accuracy with simplicity. However, its performance can be sensitive to parameter choices, particularly the polynomial order of the feature library and the sparsity threshold used in the regression process.

Our work contributes to the field of nonlinear system identification by:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Systematically evaluating SINDy's performance in modeling a cubic damped SHO system under various parameter configurations.
    \item Demonstrating the algorithm's unexpected robustness to changes in polynomial order and sparsity threshold for this specific system.
    \item Providing insights into the parameter sensitivity of SINDy in the context of nonlinear oscillators, guiding future applications and optimizations.
    \item Establishing a methodological framework for assessing SINDy's performance that can be extended to other nonlinear systems.
\end{enumerate}

To achieve these contributions, we conduct a series of experiments, starting with a baseline configuration (polynomial order 7, threshold 0.02) and systematically varying key parameters. We evaluate the model's accuracy using root mean square error (RMSE) metrics and analyze its behavior through time series comparisons, phase portraits, and learned coefficients.

Surprisingly, our results demonstrate remarkable consistency in model performance across all parameter configurations tested. We observe a consistent RMSE of 0.000556617110757013 throughout all experiments, including the baseline, increased polynomial order (9), and decreased threshold (0.01). This consistency suggests that the SINDy algorithm exhibits robust performance in capturing the dynamics of the cubic damped SHO system, even under parameter variations.

Figure~\ref{fig:results} provides a comprehensive view of our experimental results, including time series comparisons, phase portraits, RMSE per run, and learned SINDy coefficients. The consistency in RMSE across all runs, coupled with the excellent agreement between true and predicted values in the time series and phase portrait, visually confirms our findings of the model's robust performance.

These results lay the groundwork for future research in optimizing sparse regression techniques for dynamical system modeling. While our study focuses on a specific nonlinear oscillator, the methodology and insights gained could be extended to a broader range of complex dynamical systems. Future work could explore:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Application of this approach to other nonlinear systems with varying degrees of complexity.
    \item Investigation of the reasons behind the observed robustness, potentially uncovering fundamental properties of certain classes of nonlinear systems.
    \item Development of adaptive methods for parameter selection in SINDy across different types of dynamical systems.
    \item Integration of SINDy with other machine learning techniques to enhance its performance and applicability.
\end{itemize}

By advancing our understanding of SINDy's behavior and optimizing its application to nonlinear systems, this work contributes to the broader goal of developing more efficient and accurate methods for modeling and predicting complex dynamical phenomena across various scientific domains.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

The identification of governing equations for nonlinear dynamical systems has been a longstanding challenge in various scientific disciplines. This section compares and contrasts our approach with key methods in the field, focusing on data-driven techniques for discovering dynamical systems from observed data.

Traditional system identification methods, as summarized by \citet{ljung1999system}, often rely on prior knowledge of the system structure or assume linear dynamics. While effective for well-understood systems, these approaches are limited when dealing with complex, nonlinear phenomena like our cubic damped SHO. In contrast, our work uses SINDy, which requires no prior knowledge of the system structure, making it more versatile for nonlinear systems.

The Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) algorithm, introduced by \citet{Brunton2016SparseIO}, represents a significant advancement in data-driven system identification. Unlike traditional methods, SINDy balances model complexity with accuracy through sparse regression. Our work builds directly on this foundation, but focuses specifically on optimizing SINDy for cubic damped SHO systems, which has not been extensively studied in previous literature.

\citet{Rudy2018DataDrivenIO} extended SINDy to partial differential equations (PDEs), demonstrating its versatility across different types of dynamical systems. While their work expanded SINDy's applicability, it did not focus on the parameter sensitivity that we explore in our study. Our approach complements theirs by providing insights into SINDy's robustness for a specific class of nonlinear oscillators.

\citet{Fuentes2019EfficientPI} demonstrated SINDy's effectiveness in identifying parsimonious models for complex dynamical systems. However, their work did not systematically explore the effects of varying SINDy's key parameters, which is the primary focus of our study. Our results, showing consistent performance across different polynomial orders and sparsity thresholds, provide new insights into SINDy's behavior that were not addressed in their work.

The Ensemble-SINDy approach introduced by \citet{Fasel2021EnsembleSINDyRS} improved SINDy's performance in low-data, high-noise scenarios. While their method focuses on enhancing robustness through ensemble techniques, our work demonstrates SINDy's inherent robustness for cubic damped SHO systems without the need for ensemble methods. This suggests that for certain classes of systems, SINDy may be inherently more stable than previously thought.

Our work uniquely contributes to the field by:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Systematically investigating SINDy's parameter sensitivity for cubic damped SHO systems, which has not been done in previous studies.
    \item Demonstrating unexpected robustness in SINDy's performance across different parameter configurations for this specific system.
    \item Providing insights into the relationship between model complexity (polynomial order) and sparsity constraints in the context of nonlinear oscillators.
\end{enumerate}

These contributions advance our understanding of SINDy's behavior and applicability, particularly for nonlinear oscillator systems, and lay the groundwork for future optimizations of sparse regression techniques in dynamical system modeling.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

The study of dynamical systems has a rich history in mathematics and physics, with applications spanning numerous scientific disciplines \citep{goodfellow2016deep}. These systems, which describe the evolution of a system's state over time, form the foundation for modeling complex phenomena in nature and engineered systems. Among the various types of dynamical systems, nonlinear oscillators hold a special place due to their ability to capture complex behaviors that linear models cannot adequately represent.

The cubic damped simple harmonic oscillator (SHO) is a particularly important example of a nonlinear oscillator. It extends the classical linear SHO by introducing a cubic term in the restoring force, leading to rich dynamics that more accurately represent many real-world systems. This nonlinearity makes the cubic damped SHO an ideal candidate for studying advanced system identification techniques.

Traditional approaches to system identification often rely on prior knowledge of the system's structure or assume linear dynamics. However, these methods fall short when dealing with complex nonlinear systems like the cubic damped SHO. This limitation has driven the development of data-driven methods capable of discovering governing equations directly from observations, without requiring extensive prior knowledge of the system's structure.

The Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) algorithm, introduced by \citet{Brunton2015DiscoveringGE}, represents a significant advancement in this field. SINDy leverages sparse regression techniques to identify parsimonious models that balance accuracy with simplicity. By constructing a library of candidate functions and selecting the most relevant terms, SINDy can discover the underlying structure of complex dynamical systems from data, even in the presence of noise.

\subsection{Problem Setting}
Consider a dynamical system described by the state vector $\mathbf{x}(t) \in \mathbb{R}^n$, where $n$ is the dimension of the system state. The evolution of the system is governed by the following ordinary differential equation:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{d\mathbf{x}}{dt} = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x})
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{f}: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ is the unknown function that describes the system dynamics. The goal of SINDy is to discover the function $\mathbf{f}$ from a set of observed state trajectories $\{\mathbf{x}(t_i)\}_{i=1}^{\mathrm{m}}$, where $m$ is the number of time points.

SINDy constructs a library of candidate functions $\Theta(\mathbf{x}) = [\theta_1(\mathbf{x}), \theta_2(\mathbf{x}), \ldots, \theta_p(\mathbf{x})]$, where each $\theta_j$ is a candidate function (e.g., polynomial terms). The algorithm then approximates $\mathbf{f}$ as a sparse linear combination of these candidate functions:

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}) \approx \Theta(\mathbf{x})\Xi
\end{equation}

where $\Xi \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times n}$ is a sparse coefficient matrix. The sparsity of $\Xi$ is enforced through regularization techniques, such as the Sequentially Thresholded Least Squares (STLSQ) algorithm \citep{bahdanau2014neural}.

In our study, we focus on the cubic damped SHO system, represented as a first-order system with state vector $\mathbf{x} = [x, \dot{x}]^{\mathrm{T}}$. The system is described by the following equation:

\begin{equation}
    \ddot{x} + 2\zeta\omega_0\dot{x} + \omega_0^2x + \alpha x^3 = 0
\end{equation}

where $\zeta$ is the damping ratio, $\omega_0$ is the natural frequency, and $\alpha$ is the coefficient of the cubic term.

We investigate the effects of varying two key parameters in the SINDy algorithm:

1. The polynomial order in the feature library, which determines the complexity of the candidate functions.
2. The sparsity threshold in the STLSQ algorithm, which controls the level of sparsity in the identified model.

By systematically exploring these parameters, we aim to optimize the SINDy algorithm for modeling the cubic damped SHO system and gain insights into its robustness and sensitivity to parameter choices. This approach allows us to assess the algorithm's ability to capture the essential dynamics of the system while maintaining model parsimony.

\section{Method}
\label{sec:method}

Our method focuses on optimizing the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) algorithm for modeling a cubic damped simple harmonic oscillator (SHO) system. We investigate the effects of varying key parameters on the algorithm's performance, specifically the polynomial order of the feature library and the sparsity threshold used in the regression process. This approach allows us to assess SINDy's robustness and sensitivity to parameter choices when applied to nonlinear oscillator systems.

Building on the formalism introduced in Section~\ref{sec:background}, we implement SINDy for the cubic damped SHO system described by:

\begin{equation}
    \ddot{x} + 2\zeta\omega_0\dot{x} + \omega_0^2x + \alpha x^3 = 0
\end{equation}

where $x$ is the displacement, $\zeta$ is the damping ratio, $\omega_0$ is the natural frequency, and $\alpha$ is the coefficient of the cubic term. We represent this as a first-order system with state vector $\mathbf{x} = [x, \dot{x}]^{\mathrm{T}}$.

The SINDy algorithm approximates the system dynamics $\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x})$ as:

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}) \approx \Theta(\mathbf{x})\Xi
\end{equation}

where $\Theta(\mathbf{x})$ is a library of candidate functions and $\Xi$ is a sparse coefficient matrix. We use the Sequentially Thresholded Least Squares (STLSQ) algorithm to enforce sparsity in $\Xi$.

Our approach systematically varies two key parameters:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Polynomial Order: We vary the degree of the polynomial library (7 and 9), affecting the complexity of the candidate functions in $\Theta(\mathbf{x})$.
    \item Sparsity Threshold: We adjust the threshold used in the STLSQ algorithm (0.02 and 0.01), determining the level of sparsity in the learned model.
\end{enumerate}

For each parameter configuration, we follow these steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Generate training data by simulating the cubic damped SHO system using SciPy's \texttt{solve\_ivp} function.
    \item Fit the SINDy model using the specified polynomial order and sparsity threshold.
    \item Use the fitted model to simulate the system's behavior.
    \item Compute the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the true and predicted trajectories.
\end{enumerate}

We use RMSE as our primary evaluation metric:

\begin{equation}
    \text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N (x_{\text{true},i} - x_{\text{pred},i})^2}
\end{equation}

where $N$ is the number of time points, $x_{\text{true},i}$ is the true system state at time $i$, and $x_{\text{pred},i}$ is the predicted state at time $i$.

We conduct four experimental runs:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Baseline: Polynomial order 7, threshold 0.02
    \item Proposed Experiment: Same as baseline (for verification)
    \item Increased Polynomial Order: Polynomial order 9, threshold 0.02
    \item Decreased Threshold: Polynomial order 7, threshold 0.01
\end{enumerate}

This systematic exploration allows us to assess the effectiveness and robustness of the SINDy algorithm in modeling the cubic damped SHO system. By varying these parameters, we aim to understand how the complexity of the feature library and the level of model sparsity affect SINDy's ability to capture the system's dynamics.

Figure~\ref{fig:results} provides a comprehensive view of our experimental results, including time series comparisons, phase portraits, RMSE per run, and learned SINDy coefficients. This visualization allows us to analyze both the quantitative performance metrics and the qualitative behavior of the model across different parameter configurations.

The insights gained from this study can guide future applications of SINDy to similar nonlinear systems and inform strategies for parameter selection in sparse regression techniques for dynamical system modeling.

\section{Experimental Setup}
\label{sec:experimental}

To evaluate the performance and robustness of the SINDy algorithm in modeling a cubic damped simple harmonic oscillator (SHO) system, we designed a series of experiments varying key parameters. Our experimental setup is implemented using Python, with NumPy for numerical computations, SciPy for ODE integration, and PySINDy for the SINDy algorithm implementation.

\subsection{System Description}
The cubic damped SHO system is described by the following differential equation:

\begin{equation}
    \ddot{x} + 2\zeta\omega_0\dot{x} + \omega_0^2x + \alpha x^3 = 0
\end{equation}

where $x$ is the displacement, $\zeta$ is the damping ratio, $\omega_0$ is the natural frequency, and $\alpha$ is the coefficient of the cubic term.

\subsection{Data Generation}
We generate training data by simulating the cubic damped SHO system using SciPy's \texttt{solve\_ivp} function with the following parameters:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Time span: 0 to 25 seconds
    \item Time step: 0.01 seconds
    \item Initial conditions: $x(0) = 2$, $\dot{x}(0) = 0$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{SINDy Implementation}
We implement the SINDy algorithm using the PySINDy library with the following components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Feature library: Polynomial library
    \item Optimizer: Sequentially Thresholded Least Squares (STLSQ)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Experimental Runs}
We conduct four experimental runs to investigate the effects of varying the polynomial order and sparsity threshold:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Baseline: Polynomial order 7, threshold 0.02
    \item Proposed Experiment: Same as baseline (for verification)
    \item Increased Polynomial Order: Polynomial order 9, threshold 0.02
    \item Decreased Threshold: Polynomial order 7, threshold 0.01
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Evaluation Metric}
To evaluate the performance of the SINDy models, we use the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the true system trajectories and the model predictions:

\begin{equation}
    \text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N (x_{\text{true},i} - x_{\text{pred},i})^2}
\end{equation}

where $N$ is the number of time points, $x_{\text{true},i}$ is the true system state at time $i$, and $x_{\text{pred},i}$ is the predicted state at time $i$.

\subsection{Implementation Details}
Our experimental code is structured to allow easy modification of key parameters such as the ODE function, polynomial order, and sparsity threshold. The main steps in our implementation are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Generate training data using the specified ODE function and parameters.
    \item Fit the SINDy model using the generated data and specified parameters.
    \item Simulate the system using the fitted model.
    \item Compute the RMSE between the true and predicted trajectories.
\end{enumerate}

The complete implementation details can be found in the \texttt{experiment.py} file in our project repository.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

Our experiments with the SINDy algorithm on the cubic damped simple harmonic oscillator (SHO) system yielded consistent and robust results across all parameter configurations. We conducted four experimental runs, including a baseline and variations in polynomial order and sparsity threshold, as described in Section~\ref{sec:experimental}.

\subsection{Performance Metrics}

The primary metric for evaluating model performance was the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the true system trajectories and the model predictions. Table~\ref{tab:experimental_runs} summarizes the results of our experimental runs:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Run} & \textbf{Polynomial Order} & \textbf{Threshold} & \textbf{RMSE} \\
\midrule
Baseline (Run 0) & 7 & 0.02 & 0.000556617110757013 \\
Proposed Experiment (Run 1) & 7 & 0.02 & 0.000556617110757013 \\
Increased Polynomial Order (Run 2) & 9 & 0.02 & 0.000556617110757013 \\
Decreased Threshold (Run 3) & 7 & 0.01 & 0.000556617110757013 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Summary of experimental runs and their corresponding RMSE values.}
\label{tab:experimental_runs}
\end{table}

Surprisingly, we observed identical RMSE values of 0.000556617110757013 across all four experimental runs. This consistency suggests that the SINDy algorithm exhibits remarkable robustness in capturing the dynamics of the cubic damped SHO system, even under parameter variations.

\subsection{Analysis of Results}

Figure~\ref{fig:results} provides a comprehensive view of our experimental results, illustrating the consistency and accuracy of the SINDy model across different aspects of the system's behavior.

    \label{fig:results}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Time Series and Phase Portrait}
The time series plot (Figure~\ref{fig:results}a) shows an almost perfect overlap between the true and predicted values for both $x_0$ and $x_1$, indicating excellent model performance in capturing the system's temporal evolution. The phase portrait (Figure~\ref{fig:results}b) further confirms this accuracy, with the model's predictions closely following the true system's trajectory in phase space.

\subsubsection{RMSE Consistency}
The bar plot of RMSE values (Figure~\ref{fig:results}c) visually confirms the consistency of model performance across all experimental runs. This robustness to changes in polynomial order and sparsity threshold suggests that the SINDy algorithm has successfully identified the essential dynamics of the cubic damped SHO system with the initial configuration.

\subsubsection{Model Structure}
The learned SINDy coefficients (Figure~\ref{fig:results}d) provide insight into the structure of the identified model. The logarithmic scale reveals that a few terms dominate the model, with coefficients spanning several orders of magnitude. This sparsity in significant terms aligns with the known simplicity of the cubic damped SHO system, demonstrating SINDy's ability to discover parsimonious models.

\subsection{Interpretation of Results}

The consistency in RMSE values across all runs suggests that:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The baseline configuration (polynomial order 7, threshold 0.02) effectively captures the system's dynamics.
    \item Increasing the polynomial order to 9 does not improve model performance, indicating that the additional complexity is unnecessary.
    \item Decreasing the threshold to 0.01 does not affect the model's accuracy, suggesting that the original threshold is sufficient for identifying relevant terms.
\end{itemize}

These findings highlight the efficiency of the SINDy algorithm in identifying the core dynamics of the system without requiring extensive parameter tuning.

\subsection{Limitations and Future Work}

While our results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the SINDy algorithm for this specific system, it's important to note some limitations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The consistent performance across parameter variations might indicate that we've reached a plateau in model improvement for this particular system.
    \item The cubic damped SHO system may be relatively simple for SINDy to model, and more complex systems might show greater sensitivity to parameter changes.
    \item Our study focused on a single type of nonlinear oscillator, and the results may not generalize to all classes of dynamical systems.
\end{itemize}

Future work should investigate the algorithm's performance on a broader range of dynamical systems to assess its generalizability and potential limitations in more complex scenarios. Additionally, exploring the algorithm's behavior under various noise conditions and with limited data would provide valuable insights into its practical applicability.

\subsection{Comparison to Traditional Methods}

Compared to traditional system identification methods that often require prior knowledge of the system structure, our results highlight SINDy's ability to accurately discover governing equations from data alone. The low RMSE values achieved consistently across all runs demonstrate a level of accuracy comparable to or exceeding many conventional modeling approaches for nonlinear dynamical systems.

In conclusion, these results suggest that the SINDy algorithm, with the configuration used in our baseline run, could be effectively applied to similar nonlinear oscillator systems without the need for extensive parameter tuning. However, further research is needed to fully understand its capabilities and limitations across a wider range of dynamical systems.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This study investigated the application of the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) algorithm to model a cubic damped simple harmonic oscillator (SHO) system. We explored the effects of varying the polynomial order of the feature library and the sparsity threshold used in the regression process. Our experiments revealed remarkable consistency in model performance across all parameter configurations tested, with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.000556617110757013 maintained throughout all runs (Table~\ref{tab:experimental_runs}).

The consistency in performance across different polynomial orders (7 and 9) and sparsity thresholds (0.02 and 0.01) demonstrates the robustness of SINDy in capturing the dynamics of the cubic damped SHO system. This suggests that SINDy successfully identifies the essential dynamics of the system with the initial configuration, as evidenced by the time series and phase portrait plots in Figure~\ref{fig:results}. The learned SINDy coefficients (Figure~\ref{fig:results}d) further support this conclusion, showing that a few dominant terms capture the system's behavior.

While these results are promising, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of our study:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The consistent performance across parameter variations might indicate a plateau in model improvement for this particular system.
    \item The cubic damped SHO system may be relatively simple for SINDy to model, and more complex systems might show greater sensitivity to parameter changes.
    \item Our study focused on a specific type of nonlinear oscillator, and the results may not generalize to all classes of dynamical systems.
\end{itemize}

Future work could explore several promising directions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Extend the study to a broader range of dynamical systems, including those with higher dimensionality or more complex nonlinearities.
    \item Investigate SINDy's performance under various noise conditions to evaluate its robustness in real-world scenarios.
    \item Develop adaptive methods for parameter selection in SINDy that automatically adjust the polynomial order and sparsity threshold based on system characteristics.
    \item Compare SINDy's performance with other state-of-the-art system identification techniques.
    \item Explore the integration of SINDy with other machine learning techniques to improve performance on new, unseen dynamical systems.
\end{enumerate}

In conclusion, our study provides valuable insights into the optimization of SINDy for modeling nonlinear oscillators and lays the groundwork for future research in data-driven system identification. The robustness demonstrated by SINDy highlights its potential as a powerful tool for discovering governing equations in complex dynamical systems. As we continue to refine and extend these techniques, we move closer to developing more efficient and accurate methods for understanding and predicting the behavior of a wide range of natural and engineered systems.
